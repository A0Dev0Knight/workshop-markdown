# Markdown Workshop

This is a practical workshop about the syntax and the use of the [Markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
In particular, we will focus on the [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), used by GitHub.
See the full specification of the GitHub Flavored Markdown [here](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

First of all, fork [this repository](https://github.com/rosedu/workshop-markdown).
And then create a clone of your fork:

```console
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/workshop-markdown
cd workshop-markdown/
```

Replace `<your-github-username>` above with your GitHub username.

And let's get going! ðŸš€

## Markdown Use in Public Repositories

Let's start with checking how Markdown is being used in public repositories.

### This Repository

Firstly, see this `README.md` file:

```console
cat README.md
```

You could also edit it using your preferred editor (Vim, Emacs, Nano, VS Code, Sublime) to also have syntax highlighting.

Also check the [`README.github.md` file](#README.github.md), a direct copy of the [`README.md` file in the `workshop-github` repository](https://github.com/rosedu/workshop-github).
To see the actual contents of a file on GitHub (such as the [`README.md` file in the `workshop-github` repository](https://github.com/rosedu/workshop-github)), click the `Raw` button in the top-right corner.
You'll get to [this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosedu/workshop-github/refs/heads/main/README.md) in raw format.

Identify syntax aspects from those list in the documentation for [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
See:

- The use of `#`, `##`, `###` for section headings.
- The use of backticks for typewriter font, used for the names of files, functions, and 
- The use `-` and `\*` for unordered lists.
- The use of `1.` for ordered lists.
- The syntax used for links.
- The use of triple backticks for code snippets.
- And many others.

See how the Markdown syntax is rendered on GitHub for [this `README.md` file](https://github.com/rosedu/workshop-markdown/blob/main/README.md) and [the `README.github.md` file](https://github.com/rosedu/workshop-markdown/blob/main/README.github.md).

### Operating Systems (from Open Education Hub)

See Markdown files in the [Operating Systems (Open Education Hub / `cs-pub-ro`) repository](https://github.com/cs-pub-ro/operating-systems).
For files in the repository, check the raw format.
And check how they are rendered on [the website](https://cs-pub-ro.github.io/operating-systems/).

### Unikraft Docs

See Markdown files in the [Unikraft Docs repository](https://github.com/unikraft/docs).
For files in the repository, check the raw format.
And check how they are rendered on [the website](https://unikraft.org/)

### OWASP Website

See Markdown files in the [`owasp.github.io` repository](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp.github.io).
For files in the repository, check the raw format.
And check how they are rendered on [the website](https://owasp.org/).

## Using the Repository Fork

The [main repository](https://github.com/rosedu/workshop-markdown) already has branches numbered `cdl-00` to `cdl-99`.
The instructors will assign all of you a branch.

You will create pull requests **to** your assigned branch.

This means you will follow the steps:

1. Create a branch.
   Make sure you are on that branch.
1. Make changes.
1. Create commits.
1. Push changes to your fork.
1. Create a pull request from that push.
   The pull request must be target **to** your assigned branch (**not** the `main` branch).

## Correct Markdown File

The [`bad.md` Markdown file](bad.md) has errors in it.
Fix these errors as par of a pull request.
Target the pull request **to** your assigned.

Ask the instructors to review your pull request.
Make updates as required.

### Clean Up After Pull Request
